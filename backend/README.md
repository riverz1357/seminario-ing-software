# Backend - User Management Project

This project uses **NestJS** to create a protected API for user management, offering secure routes for both administrators and users, along with advanced features like importing users from an Excel file, sending personalized QR codes via email (using SendGrid), and attendance confirmation.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication** for protected routes.
- **Role-based routing** with admin and user access.
- **Email sending** with personalized QR codes via [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).
- **Attendance confirmation** through scanned QR codes.
- **User import** from Excel files.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** v14+
- **NestJS**
- **XAMPP** for local MySQL database (currently connected to a Railway database; to edit the database connection, modify the settings in `app.module.ts`).
- **SendGrid** API Key for email sending.
